# CacheBrowns

Experimental implementation of a programmable managed cached for native applications. This is a general purpose header
only library leverage declarative caches in code with an emphasis on correctness and ease of use by providing
pre-implemented strategies.

This isn't the going to set any performance records, but that's on purpose. It isn't slow, and following it's patterns
eliminates entire classes of cache invalidation bugs.

Spiritually the concepts leverage here are inspired by "one-way data flow" and managed memory.

This page will be updated when the project has reached a greater level of maturity. Look at the docs folder for any
proposals and design reviews in the mean time.

If the project goes well, we'll also create a version for .NETCore during the next hackathon.
